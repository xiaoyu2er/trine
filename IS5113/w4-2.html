        <h1>2022 NFL Predictions</h1>
        <p>
          This visualization of NFL teams predicts regular-season and playoff
          results by their respective teams' records, and predicts each team's
          probability of winning a championship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantage is: 
          <ul>
            <li>The past performance and future predictions of each
                team are very clear.</li>
            <li>Expressing the probability of success through the depth of color is very intuitive</li>
            <li>The sorting function can easily filter out the first and last positions of different indicators, which is very useful</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The disadvantage is: 
          <ul>
            <li>
                The numbers are not cool enough to tell the difference in the probability of winning the championship.
            </li>
          </ul>
