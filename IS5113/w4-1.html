        <h1>2022 NFL Predictions</h1>
        <p>
          Express the probability of Democrats and Republicans winning the White
          House through different visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good part is: the second picture shows the situation in different
          constituencies in each state in different colors, so that the audience
          can see the distribution of constituencies won by Democrats and
          Republicans as a whole, and can also be specific to a constituency.
          Interestingly, all the constituencies make up the shape of the United
          States.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bad part is: It is impossible to see the changes in the Republican
          and Democratic seats according to the time dimension.
